### Contributing

If you're new to Github, there's a process to push changes to the project. We do this to validate that all changes are correct, working, and all tests are passing.

1. Choose an issue from the project repository at GitLab. (Either one person opened it, or you did).

2. From ```Dev```, checkout a new Branch ```git checkout -b type/branch_name```. Where ```type``` is a general idea of what's implemented. E.g. ```fix```, ```feature```, ```enhancement```, etc.

3. Make your changes, features, enhancements, etc. in your local branch.

4. Push your finished code ```git push -u origin <branch_name>```.

5. Create a pull request, review this code with your team.

6. If everything is okay, then merge with ```Dev```.

7. Choose the next issue.

8. At the end of the day/week/month, when all Pull Requests and issues are in ```Dev```, merge with master, push, and deploy (next section).

#### Contributing TIPS

* If you see a bug, open an issue.
* If you see a problem, open an issue.
* if you see an area of opportunity (refactor code), open an issue.
* If you see an area of opportunity (a new feature or something cool), open an issue.
* Be honest, don't merge with ```Dev``` until all tests pass, the code works and you've actually seen it work.
